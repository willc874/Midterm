		<h3 class="h3"><a id="sectionone"></a>Life and Work</h3>
		<hr>
		<p>Addario was born in Norwalk, Connecticut, United States;<a href="#linktwo">[2]</a>her parents were Italian-American hairdressers.<a href="#linkthree">[3]</a> She graduated from Staples High School, in Westport, Connecticut, in 1991 <a href="#linkfour">[4]</a>and from the University of Wisconsin-Madison in 1995.She began photographing professionally in 1996 with, as she says, "no professional photographic training" when she started at the Buenos Aires Herald in Argentina,and then began freelancing for the Associated Press, with Cuba as a focus.[citation needed]

		In 2000, she photographed in Afghanistan under Taliban control.She has since covered conflicts in Afghanistan, Iraq, Darfur, Republic of the Congo, and Haiti. <a href="#linkfive">[5]</a> She has covered stories throughout the Middle East and Africa. <a href="#linksix">[6]</a> Starting in August 2004, she visited Darfur and neighboring Chad several times.<a href="#linkseven">[7]</a><a href="#linkeight">[8]</a>

		She has photographed for The New York Times,<a href="#linknine">[9]</a> The New York Times Magazine, Time, Newsweek, and National Geographic. <a href="#linkten">[10]</a>

		In Pakistan on May 9, 2009, Addario was involved in an automobile accident while returning to Islamabad from an assignment at a refugee camp. Her collar bone (clavicle) was broken, another journalist was injured, and the driver was killed. <a href="#linkeleven">[11]</a>

		Addario was one of four New York Times journalists who were missing in Libya from March 16–21, 2011. The New York Times reported on March 18, 2011 that Libya had agreed to free her and three colleagues: Anthony Shadid, Stephen Farrell and Tyler Hicks. <a href="#linktwelve">[12]</a> The Libyan government released the four journalists on March 21, 2011. She reports that she was threatened with death and repeatedly groped during her captivity by the Libyan Army.

		In November 2011, The New York Times wrote a letter of complaint on behalf of Addario to the Israeli government, after allegations that Israeli soldiers at the Erez Crossing had strip-searched and mocked her and forced her to go through an X-ray scanner three times despite knowing that she was pregnant. Addario reported that she had "never, ever been treated with such blatant cruelty." The Israeli Defence ministry subsequently issued an apology to both Addario and The New York Times.

		The extensive exhibition In Afghanistan at the Nobel Peace Center in Oslo, Norway has her photos of Afghan women juxtaposed with Tim Hetherington's photographs from American soldiers in the Korangal Valley.</p>
